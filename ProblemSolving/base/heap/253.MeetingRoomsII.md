```python
class Solution(object):
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        intervals=sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
        heap=[]
        ans=0
        for s, e in interÂ vals:
            if len(heap)==0 or s<heap[0]:
                heapq.heappush(heap, e)
            else:
                while len(heap)>0 and heap[0]<=s:
                    heapq.heappop(heap)
                heapq.heappush(heap, e)
            ans=max(ans, len(heap))
