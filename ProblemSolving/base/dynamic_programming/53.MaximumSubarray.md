## leetcode - 53. Maximum Subarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/
### problem
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

*If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.


### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp=[0]*len(nums)
        dp[0]=nums[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            dp[i]=dp[i-1]+nums[i] if dp[i-1]+nums[i]>nums[i] else nums[i]
            
        return max(dp)
```
