## leetcode - 141. Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
### problem
```
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```
### solution
1. storing visited nodes
```python
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        nodeSeen=set()
        crr=head
        while crr:
            if crr in nodeSeen:
                return True
            nodeSeen.add(crr)
            print(crr.val)
            crr=crr.next
        return False
```

        faster=head
        while faster and faster.next and faster.next.next:
            slower=slower.next
            faster=faster.next.next
            if slower==faster:
                return True
        return False
