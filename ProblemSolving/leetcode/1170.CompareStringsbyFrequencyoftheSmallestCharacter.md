## leetcode - 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character
https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-strings-by-frequency-of-the-smallest-character/
### problem
```
Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.

 

Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
```
### solution
```python
import bisect 
class Solution(object):
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries, words):
        """
        :type queries: List[str]
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        q_ans=[q.count(min(q)) for q in queries]
        w_ans=[w.count(min(w)) for w in words]
        w_ans.sort()

        ans=[]
        for q in q_ans:
            i=bisect.bisect(w_ans, q)
            ans.append(len(w_ans)-i)
        return ans
```
