## leetcode - 763. Partition Labels
https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/
### problem
```
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
Note:

S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        rev_index={}

        for i in range(len(S)-1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] not in rev_index:
                rev_index[S[i]]=i
        ans=[]
        crr_first=0
        crr_last=-1
        for i, s in enumerate(S):
            if rev_index[s]>crr_last:
                crr_last=rev_index[s]
            if i>=crr_last:
                ans.append(crr_last-crr_first+1)
                crr_first=i+1
        return ans
```
