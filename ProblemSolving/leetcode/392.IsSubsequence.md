## leetcode - 392. Is Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
### problem
```
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s_list=list(s)
        if len(s_list)<=0:
            return True
        c=s_list.pop(0)
        for e in t:
            if c==e:
                if len(s_list)<=0:
                    return True
                c=s_list.pop(0)
        return False     
```
