## leetcode - 337. House Robber III
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/
### problem
```
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return (0, 0)
            l=dfs(node.left)
            r=dfs(node.right)
            return (l[1]+r[1], max(l[0]+r[0]+node.val, l[1]+r[1]))
        return max(dfs(root))
