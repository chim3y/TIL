## leet code - single number
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
### problem
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        list_sum=sum(nums)
        set_nums=list(set(nums))
        set_sum=sum(set_nums)
        return 2*set_sum-list_sum
```
