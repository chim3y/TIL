https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/
### problem
```
Given an array of strings arr. String s is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of arr which have unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and "ique".
Maximum length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".
Example 3:

Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxLength(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        sub=[set()]
        for a in arr:
            if len(a)>len(set(a)):
                continue
            a=set(a)
            for s in sub:
                if a&s: continue
                sub.append(a|s)

        print(sub)
        return max([len(s) for s in sub])
