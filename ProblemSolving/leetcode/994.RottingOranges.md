## leetcode - 994. Rotting Oranges
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
### problem
```
In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

 

Example 1:



Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 

Note:

1 <= grid.length <= 10
1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def orangesRotting(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int

        queue=[]
        ans=0
        cnt=0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j]==2:
                    queue.append((i, j, 0))
                elif grid[i][j]==1:
                    cnt+=1
        tmp=[[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        while queue:
            crr=queue.pop(0)
            ans=crr[2]
            for t in tmp:
                ni, nj=crr[0]+t[0], crr[1]+t[1]
                if ni>=0 and nj>=0 and ni<len(grid) and nj<len(grid[0]):
                    if grid[ni][nj]==1:
                        grid[ni][nj]=2
                        queue.append((ni, nj, ans+1))
                        cnt-=1
        

        return ans if cnt==0 else -1
