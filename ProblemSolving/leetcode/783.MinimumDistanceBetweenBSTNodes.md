## leetcode - 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/
### problem
```
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example :

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
Note:

The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):

    def inorder(self, root):
        if root.left:
            self.inorder(root.left)
        self.sorted_list.append(root.val)
        if root.right:
            self.inorder(root.right)
            
    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.sorted_list=[]
        self.inorder(root)
        ans=100
        for i in range(len(self.sorted_list)-1):
            ans=min(ans, self.sorted_list[i+1]-self.sorted_list[i])
        return ans
