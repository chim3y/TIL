## leetcode - Assign Cookies
### problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
```
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1
```

### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
        """
        :type g: List[int]
        :type s: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(g)<=0 or len(s)<= 0:
            return 0
        
        g.sort(reverse=True)
        s.sort(reverse=True)
        
        content=0
        
        ch=g.pop()
        co=s.pop()
        
        while True:
            if co >= ch:
                content=content+1
                if len(g)>0 and len(s)>0:
                    ch=g.pop()
                    co=s.pop()
                else:
                    break
            else :
                if len(s)>0:
                    co=s.pop()
                else:
                    break
        
        return content
                
```
