## leetcode - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
### problem
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_len=0
        for i, e in enumerate(s):
            e_list=[e]
            
            for ee in s[i+1:]:
                if ee not in e_list:
                    e_list.append(ee)
                else:
                    break
            new_length=len(e_list)
            if max_len < new_length:
                max_len=new_length
        
        return max_len
```
