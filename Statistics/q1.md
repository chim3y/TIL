### Selection bias

- It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isnâ€™t random
- It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples
1. sampling bias
    - systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population
2. time interval
    - A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.
3. data
    - When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.
4. Attrition
    - Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion.
